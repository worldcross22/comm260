        <p>I’m a runner from Marinette, WI, who ran in college at UW-Platteville.  I run for the glory of running and everything that it involves.  I will always be a runner; I can’t imagine life without running.  If you used to run, and now do not, or are thinking about quitting running, I’ve got to ask two questions:  Can you imagine what life would be like if you would have never started running?  Maybe it’s just me, but I think that my life has been ten times more worth living since I’ve started running.  If your life is even twice as good as it was before you started running, why would you quit running?  This page is dedicated to running and provides many links and statistics.

        <!-- <p style = "font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:16px;font-style:italic;">My wife started running on 02/01/2008, when she registered to do a half marathon.  At the time, her life was not headed in the right direction.  She wanted to turn it around, so she thought back to when she felt the best.  It happened to be when she was in really good shape athletically, playing highschool sports.  So she figured starting to run would be a great way to get back into shape.  She also needed a stress reliever -that which running does well.  At the time, she had never worn a pair of running shoes.  But 5 years later, she achieved American Developmental Program Status at the Chicago Marathon finishing in 3 hours 6 seconds, and has broken the 3 hour barrier twice thereafter.</p> -->
